# Introduction to [!include[interface](../includes/product-long.md)] [!include[version](../includes/product-version.md)]

<!-- Introduction customized for ABB 800xA -->

The [!include[interface](../includes/product-long.md)] [!include[version](../includes/product-version.md)] uses event streaming technology to collect ABB system data from ABB API to create Event Frames in PI Asset Framework.

You can define templates that help to specify which events trigger Event Frame creation, configure how the property or tag is named, and define the data to be stored.
