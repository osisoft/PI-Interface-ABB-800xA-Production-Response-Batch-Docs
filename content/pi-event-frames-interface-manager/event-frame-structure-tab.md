# Event Frame Structure Tab

On this tab, you define the event frames to be generated for each level of your event frame hierarchy. For each level, you define the active point that triggers the start and end of the event, the method for assigning a name to the event frame, and any additional data (attributes) that you want to populate when the event starts.

## Configuration Name

Descriptive name for the event frame level that you are defining.

## Event Frame Template

Specify the template that defines the structure of the event frames to be created for this level of the hierarchy. To define event frame templates, launch PI System Explorer and browse to the Library tab. When you define the event frame template, you can define attributes that are populated when the event frame is created. Ensure that the data type of the attributes is string. When you select an event frame template, the attribute table is populated with its attributes.
