# Release Notes

PI Interface for ABB800xA Production Response Batch Release

**Version 5.1.6.9**

## Overview

PI Interface for ABB 800xA Production Response Batch uses event streaming technology to collect ABB task driven system data from an ABB API. The interface converts this data to PI tags and PI batch properties and stores the collected data as event frames and elements within PI Asset Framework (PI AF). You can use tag templates to control PI point creation and event population. All elements, tags, tag aliases, and health tags are automatically created on the PI and AF Servers.

This interface requires ***ABB Ability Manufacturing Operations Management Process Intelligence SDK*** to be installed by the end user to enable interface operation.

This interface is compatible with the following 800xA Production Response MES versions:

* 6.0.3.2
* 6.0.3.3
* 6.1.1

The 5.1.6.9 release of PI Interface for ABB800xA Production Response Batch internally replaces PI SDK with AF SDK - this improves the security, robustness, and communication capabilities of the interface.

Note: There are two OSIsoft interfaces for ABB800xA Batch -- one for the Production Data Log (Oracle-based 800xA backend), and one for Production Response (SQL-based 800xA backend). Please ensure this interface is compatible with your ABB 800xA version before proceeding.

| Work Item | Description                                                                     |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 22133     | Attribute values referencing other event frames are captured regardless of the order event frames are created. |
| 22140     | Unirecord data sources are now included in unirecord imports and exports. |
| 22151     | Duplicate event frames are not created when BatchID or Name contains not allowed characters. |
| 22156     | Cache start and end times can no longer be permanently altered by arbitration events. |
| 22196     | Event frames separated by more than cache time no longer merge. |
| 22209     | Interface will no longer have a delay in processing a batch when the local time is greater than GMT. |
| 22211     | MONITORTAGWINDOW now defaults to 0, meaning monitor tag counts don't get trimmed to the most recent <MONITORTAGWINDOW> days of activity and roll over at INT_MAX unless MONITORTAGWINDOW is deliberately set. |
| 22216     | Interface ID has been added to the message logs in order to uniquely identify log message.
| 22218     | All generated unirecords will have the placeholder [TIMESTAMP] have the format "YYYY-MM-DD" for a SQL source and "YYYY/MM/DD" for non SQL source like EVT files. |
| 22219     | Unit procedure level event frames using different units will no longer be merged. |
| 22221     | Monitor tags now accurately reflect the number of batches and their child events. |
| 22235     | Interface configuration for RST and RET reads United States format standard. |
| 22245     | The unit procedure batch id attribute is controlled by the unit procedure recipe template batchid. |
| 22250     | Merging issue causes unit procedure and operation not to close. |
| 22251     | Empty UniRecord dump files are no longer generated. |
| 22260     | Batch event frames no longer merge event frames when merging is disabled and unique ids do not match. |
| 22268     | All RST and RET within the configuration will be parsed as US format. Fix in current development branch and in 4.3.x.x Branch. |
| 22275     | A check that verifies that a Procedure Event Frame and a Unit Procedure Event Frame are both generated by the same interface instance before linking them together. |
| 22281     | Procedures created by Operation recipes are properly updated extended properties for determining end time and merge. |
| 22283     | The Event log source is created during the interface install step. |
| 22289     | When network interruptions cause AFSDK to becomes out of sync and throw duplicate uniqueid exceptions, the interface attempts to complete the rest of the checkin, set the offending event frame(s) to a checked in state, and exits. | 
| 24117     | Interface now supports the INCLUDEINCOMPLETEDATA configuration option. If set to true, the interface creates unit procedures and all its children without a unit. |
| 25811     | PI data server collectives and PI buffering to multiple PI data servers is now supported. |
| 25995     | There is a new AFERR (-500) value that gets set on the Batch Status tag during an EFGEN AF check in error. Customers can monitor the value of the tag and notifications and analyses can be performed in the event that an error occurs. |
| 26466     | Batch Interfaces now support an AF Interface Statistics element that stores the values of the PI tags recorded during interface execution. The location of the newly created element can be configured using the Batch Interface Configuration Manager and passed through the INI file. |
| 26756     | With the release of version 5, if you have a batch interface supported batch database, it will no longer be able to write to PIBatch Database. Version 5  only supports Event Frames Customers who need to write to PIBatch. The database needs to stay with Version 4.x.x.x Batch Interfaces. |
| 27053     | Added new logging level 3 (DB) to include Unirecord diagnostics messages into message log. |
| 27091     | Extra emphasis on ensuring AF checkin is performed before disconnecting, as well as the addition of the AFAutoCheckin feature. |
| 50935     | Addressed advanced parsing issue when using LBE ("Left Bound Exclusive"). |
| 52120     | Whenever an interface becomes the primary, it will use the /RST command line switch as the start date and process the batches. |
| 67289     | UniRecord exports now include all UniRecord fields. |
| 67298     | Event sorting is faster and memory consumption is better managed during event queuing. |
| 68907     | Default account to setup interface service is now Default Virtual User (NT Service/<Interface Instance Name>). |
| 69287     | Updated the BIFConfig utility to only allow TagPath properties to be set on Asset Templates and Property Templates. Fixed issue where the TAGPATH value was not being saved properly. |
| 69486     | All attributes are now created on the correct event frame. |
| 70398     | Float tag values are now evaluated correctly. |
| 70403     | Message logging includes exception data. |
| 70471     | Very long log messages are successfully logged. |
| 72522     | Interface stability improvements. |
| 73489     | Interface no longer hangs due to locale thread lock issue. |
| 73498     | Setup kit creates the event source name under application logs to match with Interface application name (which is used by logging framework). |
| 74332     | Fixes minor failover issues and includes a health tag that can be used to monitor failover status. 
| 74583     | Removed constraint errors. |
